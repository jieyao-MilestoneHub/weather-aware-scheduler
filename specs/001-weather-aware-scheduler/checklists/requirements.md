# Specification Quality Checklist: Weather-Aware Scheduler

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**: Spec successfully avoids implementation details. Focuses on what/why rather than how. Uses plain language throughout with clear user value propositions.

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**:
- All 30 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001: "System MUST accept natural language scheduling requests as text input")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: "under 30 seconds", SC-003: "≤ 1 clarification rounds")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Users can create a simple schedule" not "API responds in X ms")
- 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases section covers 7 boundary conditions
- Out of Scope section clearly bounds v1
- Assumptions section documents 8 key assumptions and default behaviors

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Notes**:
- Each functional requirement is written as MUST statement with clear acceptance criteria
- 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover: simple scheduling, weather-aware decisions, conflict resolution, visualization
- 13 measurable success criteria defined (SC-001 through SC-013)
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic language throughout

## Validation Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

**Items Passing**: 16/16 (100%)

**Items Failing**: 0/16

**Critical Issues**: None

**Recommendations**:
- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All constitutional requirements met:
  - ✅ Code Quality: Clear requirements for readability and error handling (FR-019 through FR-022)
  - ✅ Testing Standards: Golden-path test requirements defined (FR-027 through FR-030)
  - ✅ UX Consistency: User interaction and error communication standards (FR-017, FR-018, FR-021)
  - ✅ Performance Requirements: Response time targets defined (SC-006, SC-008)

**Next Steps**:
1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
2. Or run `/speckit.clarify` if additional refinement needed (though spec is already comprehensive)
