# Feature Specification: Weather-Aware Scheduler

**Feature Branch**: `001-weather-aware-scheduler`
**Created**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Weather-Aware Scheduler - A lightweight, explainable scheduling system that parses natural inputs, reasons about conditions (weather/conflicts), and produces clear, testable, and visualized results."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Simple Schedule Creation (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly schedule a meeting by typing a natural language sentence and receive immediate confirmation with a structured schedule.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - reducing friction in everyday scheduling. Without this, the system has no foundation. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering "Friday 14:00 Taipei meet Alice 60 min" and verifying a structured schedule is returned with event details (time, location, attendee, duration).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no conflicts or weather concerns exist, **When** user enters "Friday 14:00 Taipei meet Alice 60 min", **Then** system creates a confirmed event and displays summary with all extracted details
2. **Given** user provides partial information, **When** user enters "meet Alice Friday", **Then** system asks for missing required fields (time, duration, location) exactly once
3. **Given** user provides ambiguous time reference, **When** user enters "Friday afternoon coffee", **Then** system interprets "afternoon" as 14:00 (2pm) by default and confirms with user
4. **Given** valid schedule request, **When** event is created, **Then** output includes structured summary with: attendee name, location, date/time, duration

---

### User Story 2 - Weather-Aware Scheduling (Priority: P2)

A user wants the system to consider weather conditions when scheduling outdoor activities and receive proactive suggestions for adjustments or preparations.

**Why this priority**: This is the key differentiator from standard scheduling tools. Adds significant user value by preventing weather-related disruptions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering "Tomorrow afternoon Taipei coffee (rain backup)" and verifying the system detects rain probability, suggests indoor venues or time adjustments, and provides reasoning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** high rain probability detected (>60%) for scheduled time, **When** user requests outdoor meeting, **Then** system suggests indoor venue alternative with explanation "High rain probability (>60%) detected"
2. **Given** moderate rain probability detected (30-60%), **When** user schedules event, **Then** system creates event with note "Bring an umbrella - moderate rain chance"
3. **Given** rain detected within ±2 hours of requested time, **When** user schedules outdoor event, **Then** system suggests time shift options (±1-2 hours) with weather reasoning
4. **Given** clear weather forecast, **When** user schedules outdoor activity, **Then** system confirms without modifications and notes "Clear weather expected"

---

### User Story 3 - Conflict Resolution (Priority: P3)

A user wants automatic detection and resolution of scheduling conflicts, with the system proposing alternative time slots when conflicts exist.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability and prevents double-booking, but the system is useful without this if users manually track their calendar.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering "Friday 3pm team sync 30min" (a pre-configured conflict time) and verifying the system detects the conflict and proposes the next available slots.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** requested time slot is already booked, **When** user attempts to schedule event, **Then** system detects conflict and proposes next 3 available time slots
2. **Given** conflict detected, **When** user is presented with alternatives, **Then** user can select one option or decline all
3. **Given** user selects an alternative slot, **When** confirmation is received, **Then** system creates event at new time and displays summary
4. **Given** multiple conflicts exist in a day, **When** user requests scheduling, **Then** system finds first available slot that meets duration requirements

---

### User Story 4 - Process Visualization (Priority: P4)

A developer or power user wants to understand the system's decision-making process through a visual flowchart showing all decision branches and logic paths.

**Why this priority**: Critical for developers and solution engineers who need to understand, debug, or extend the system. Not essential for end-user value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a visualization export command and verifying a flowchart file (Mermaid/Graphviz format) is generated showing all nodes (extract, weather check, conflict check, decision) and edges (conditions).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** system has processed requests, **When** user requests flow visualization, **Then** system exports process flow diagram in Mermaid or Graphviz format
2. **Given** visualization is generated, **When** developer opens diagram, **Then** all decision nodes are labeled with conditions (rain check, conflict check, slot validation)
3. **Given** flow diagram exists, **When** embedded in documentation, **Then** new users can understand system logic within 5 minutes
4. **Given** system logic changes, **When** visualization is regenerated, **Then** diagram accurately reflects current decision paths

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when user provides invalid date/time?** System asks for clarification exactly once with examples of valid formats (e.g., "Friday 2pm", "2025-10-17 14:00")
- **What happens when location is missing?** System prompts once for location or uses default location if configured
- **What happens when attendee information is unclear?** System asks "Who is this meeting with?" exactly once
- **What happens when duration exceeds reasonable limits (>8 hours)?** System confirms with user: "Confirming: event duration is [X] hours - is this correct?"
- **What happens when weather service is unavailable?** System creates event without weather check and notes "Weather information unavailable - manual weather check recommended"
- **What happens when multiple interpretations of input exist?** System presents options and asks user to select once
- **What happens when all suggested alternative slots are rejected?** System responds "No suitable time found - please provide preferred time manually"

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can create a simple schedule (no conflicts, clear weather) in under 30 seconds from input to confirmation
- **SC-002**: System achieves 100% success rate on 5 golden-path test scenarios in mock mode
- **SC-003**: Average clarification rounds per request is ≤ 1 (system asks for missing info at most once)
- **SC-004**: New developers can understand system flow visualization within 5 minutes
- **SC-005**: Weather-adjusted schedules include clear reasoning that users can understand without technical knowledge
- **SC-006**: System processes single schedule request and returns result in under 3 seconds (mock mode)
- **SC-007**: System handles ambiguous input (missing time or location) and successfully completes scheduling within 2 interactions
- **SC-008**: 100% of conflicts are detected and alternative slots are proposed within 1 second
- **SC-009**: All decision branches include transparent explanation: "why" this decision was made and "what" the user should do
- **SC-010**: System degrades gracefully: 100% of service failures result in clear user guidance rather than error crashes

### User Satisfaction

- **SC-011**: Users report scheduling is "faster than manual calendar tools" in feedback surveys
- **SC-012**: Weather-aware suggestions prevent at least 80% of outdoor events during rain in test scenarios
- **SC-013**: Users successfully interpret system output (summary, reason, notes) without additional explanation 95% of the time

## Assumptions

- **Weather data scope**: For v1 mock mode, rain detection uses simple keyword matching ("rain") and predefined time windows. Real weather API integration is future scope.
- **Conflict detection scope**: For v1 mock mode, conflicts use predefined blocked times (e.g., "Friday 3pm"). Real calendar API integration is future scope.
- **Timezone handling**: All times are assumed to be in the location's local timezone. Cross-timezone planning is out of scope for v1.
- **Default interpretations**:
  - "afternoon" = 14:00 (2pm)
  - "morning" = 09:00 (9am)
  - "evening" = 18:00 (6pm)
  - Default duration if not specified = 60 minutes
- **Supported input language**: English only for v1
- **Location format**: City name (e.g., "Taipei", "New York") without requiring country or coordinates
- **Attendee handling**: Supports single or multiple attendees; names are stored as provided without validation
- **Interface**: CLI-based for v1; desktop UI integration is future scope

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Real-time weather API integration (using mocks)
- Real calendar service integration (using mocks)
- Multi-user scheduling negotiation
- Route optimization or travel time calculations
- Cross-timezone meeting scheduling
- Recurring events
- Event reminders or notifications
- Integration with email or messaging systems
- Mobile application interface
- Authentication or user account management
- LangSmith tracing and evaluation automation (future: M2-M4)
- RAG-based venue suggestions (future: M2-M4)
- Multi-model strategy and cost optimization (future: M2-M4)

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Ambiguous natural language input leads to incorrect slot extraction | High - wrong meetings scheduled | Implement slot-filling: ask for clarification on missing/unclear fields exactly once; validate extracted data before proceeding |
| Weather/conflict detection rules misfire with mock data | Medium - incorrect suggestions | Include explicit rule documentation; provide manual override path; clear fallback message "manual review suggested" |
| Visualization is too complex for new users to understand | Medium - reduced developer adoption | Test visualization readability with new users; include labeled conditions on all nodes/edges; provide legend |
| Service failures cause crashes instead of graceful degradation | High - poor user experience | Implement retry-once logic; proceed with warnings when services unavailable; never fail completely - always provide output |
| Users don't understand system reasoning | Medium - distrust in suggestions | Always include "reason" and "notes" in output; use plain language; test explanations with non-technical users |

## Glossary

- **Slot**: Structured extracted fields from natural language input containing city, datetime, duration, and attendees
- **High rain risk**: Weather condition with >60% rain probability that triggers indoor venue or time adjustment suggestions
- **Golden path**: Minimal representative test case covering a key success or failure flow; used for quick regression validation
- **Mock mode**: System operation using simulated data (predefined weather and conflicts) without requiring external API keys
- **Clarification round**: Single interaction where system asks user to provide missing or unclear information
- **Time shift**: Adjustment of scheduled time by ±1-2 hours to avoid unfavorable weather conditions
- **Graceful degradation**: System behavior where it continues operating with reduced functionality rather than failing completely when external services are unavailable
