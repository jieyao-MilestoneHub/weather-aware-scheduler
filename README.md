# Weather-Aware Scheduler

A lightweight, explainable scheduling system that parses natural language inputs, evaluates weather conditions and calendar conflicts, and produces clear, testable scheduling decisions with transparent reasoning.

## Features

- **Natural Language Input:** Schedule meetings by typing plain English
- **Weather-Aware:** Automatically detects rain risk and suggests adjustments
- **Conflict Detection:** Checks calendar availability and proposes alternatives
- **Transparent Decisions:** Every decision includes clear reasoning and notes
- **Offline-First:** Mock mode requires zero API keys (perfect for development)
- **Visualizable:** Generate flowcharts showing decision-making process
- **Test-Driven:** 100% tested with golden-path scenarios

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Schedule a Meeting

```bash
weather-scheduler schedule "Friday 2pm Taipei meet Alice 60min"
```

**Output:**
```
✓ Event Created

Meeting scheduled in Taipei
Reason: No conflicts detected, weather conditions acceptable
```

### Generate Workflow Visualization

```bash
weather-scheduler visualize
```

This creates `graph/flow.mermaid` and `graph/flow.dot` showing the decision flow.

## User Stories

### ✅ User Story 1: Simple Schedule Creation (MVP)

**Goal:** Quickly schedule meetings with natural language

**Example:**
```bash
weather-scheduler schedule "Next Monday 10am review meeting 45min"
```

### ✅ User Story 2: Weather-Aware Scheduling

**Goal:** Get proactive weather-based suggestions

**Example:**
```bash
weather-scheduler schedule "Tomorrow afternoon Taipei coffee rain backup"
```

**Output:** System detects rain risk and suggests indoor venue or time shift

### ✅ User Story 3: Conflict Resolution

**Goal:** Automatically detect conflicts and propose alternatives

**Example:**
```bash
weather-scheduler schedule "Friday 3pm team sync 30min"
```

**Output:** 3 alternative time slots if conflict detected

### 🚧 User Story 4: Process Visualization

**Goal:** Understand decision flow through visual diagrams

**Example:**
```bash
weather-scheduler visualize
```

**Output:** Mermaid and DOT format diagrams

## System Architecture

### Decision Flow

```
Input → Parse & Validate → Check Weather → Check Calendar
                                              ↓
                                      Conflict/Weather Risk?
                                              ↓
                                   Yes ← → No
                                    ↓         ↓
                           Suggest Adjust   Create Event
                                    ↓         ↓
                                  Output Summary
```

### Components

- **Parser:** Natural language → structured slot (city, datetime, duration, attendees)
- **Validator:** Ensure dates are valid and in future
- **Weather Tool:** Check rain probability (mock mode: keyword + time window rules)
- **Calendar Tool:** Check conflicts (mock mode: predefined blocked times)
- **Policy Engine:** Decide: create, adjust time, adjust place, or propose alternatives
- **Formatter:** Structured output → Rich CLI display

### Technology Stack

- **LangGraph:** State machine orchestration
- **Pydantic v2:** Strict type validation
- **Typer + Rich:** CLI interface with beautiful output
- **pytest:** Test framework with 90%+ coverage
- **python-dateutil:** Relative date parsing

## Development

### Run Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

# Specific test type
pytest tests/unit/ -v
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

### Run Dataset Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/replay_eval.py
```

**Expected:** 5/5 tests passing (100% success rate)

### Quick Development Cycle

```bash
bash scripts/dev_run.sh
```

Runs: setup → tests → CLI example → visualization → dataset replay

## Configuration

### Mock Mode (Default - No API Keys Required)

The system operates in mock mode by default, using:
- **Mock Weather Tool:** Keyword detection + time window rules
- **Mock Calendar Tool:** Predefined conflicts

Edit `configs/graph.config.yaml`:
```yaml
feature_flags:
  providers: "mock"  # No API keys required
```

### Real API Mode (Future)

To use real weather/calendar APIs, create `.env`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_...
```

Update `configs/graph.config.yaml`:
```yaml
feature_flags:
  providers: "mcp"  # Use real APIs
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Pyramid

- **Unit Tests:** Parser, validator, time utils, formatters, mock tools
- **Integration Tests:** Full graph flows (sunny, rainy, conflict, missing info, failures)
- **Contract Tests:** Ensure mock and real tools have identical interfaces

### Golden Path Scenarios

1. **Sunny:** No conflicts, clear weather → Direct success
2. **Rainy:** High rain probability → Adjustment suggested
3. **Conflict:** Calendar clash → 3 alternatives proposed
4. **Missing:** Incomplete input → Clarification requested
5. **Failure:** Service unavailable → Graceful degradation
