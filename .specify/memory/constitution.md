# Weather-Aware Scheduler Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards

**MUST** maintain consistently high code quality across the entire codebase:

- **Readability First**: Code MUST be self-documenting with clear naming conventions; complex logic MUST include explanatory comments
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, or function MUST have one clear purpose; violations require explicit justification in code review
- **DRY Principle**: Code duplication beyond 3 lines MUST be refactored into shared utilities or libraries
- **Type Safety**: MUST use strong typing where available; untyped code requires documented justification
- **Error Handling**: All error conditions MUST be explicitly handled; no silent failures permitted
- **Code Review**: All changes MUST pass peer review before merge; reviewer MUST verify constitutional compliance

**Rationale**: Weather-aware scheduling requires reliable, maintainable code that can be debugged quickly when issues arise. Poor code quality leads to bugs that could result in missed schedules or incorrect weather-based decisions.

### II. Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST** follow test-driven development practices without exception:

- **Test-First Mandatory**: Tests MUST be written before implementation; tests MUST fail initially to prove they test the right behavior
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Strictly enforce the TDD cycle—failing test → minimal implementation → refactor
- **Coverage Requirements**:
  - Critical paths (weather data processing, scheduling logic): 100% coverage required
  - Business logic: minimum 90% coverage required
  - UI/presentation layer: minimum 70% coverage required
- **Test Pyramid**: Unit tests (foundation) → Integration tests (middle) → Contract tests (top)
- **Test Types Required**:
  - **Unit Tests**: Every function/method with business logic MUST have unit tests
  - **Integration Tests**: Required for weather API integration, data persistence, scheduler execution
  - **Contract Tests**: Required for external API boundaries (weather services, user APIs)
- **Test Hygiene**: Tests MUST be fast (<5s per test suite), isolated, deterministic, and independently runnable

**Rationale**: Weather scheduling involves critical timing decisions. Inadequate testing could lead to scheduling failures during severe weather conditions, potentially causing safety issues or significant business disruption.

### III. User Experience Consistency

**MUST** deliver a consistent, intuitive user experience across all interfaces:

- **Interface Clarity**: Every user interaction MUST have clear feedback (success, failure, in-progress states)
- **Error Communication**: Error messages MUST be user-friendly, actionable, and never expose internal implementation details
- **Response Time Standards**:
  - User actions MUST acknowledge within 100ms
  - Data loading MUST show progress indicators for operations >500ms
  - Operations exceeding 3s MUST provide cancellation option
- **Accessibility**: All interfaces MUST meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards minimum
- **Consistency Across Channels**: Whether CLI, API, or UI, equivalent operations MUST use consistent terminology, parameter names, and behavior
- **Documentation**: Every user-facing feature MUST include:
  - Plain-language description in quickstart.md
  - Usage examples with expected output
  - Common troubleshooting scenarios

**Rationale**: Users need confidence that weather-based scheduling decisions are correct. Confusing interfaces or inconsistent behavior erodes trust and leads to user errors or misinterpretation of weather conditions.

### IV. Performance Requirements

**MUST** meet defined performance standards to ensure reliable operation:

- **Weather Data Freshness**: Weather data MUST be fetched within 30 seconds of scheduled check; stale data (>15 minutes old) MUST trigger alert
- **Schedule Computation**:
  - Single schedule evaluation: <200ms p95
  - Batch schedule processing: <5s for 1000 schedules
- **API Response Times**:
  - Read operations: <100ms p95
  - Write operations: <300ms p95
  - Bulk operations: progress streaming required for >3s operations
- **Resource Constraints**:
  - Memory: <500MB for typical workloads (100 active schedules)
  - CPU: MUST NOT block event loop for >50ms
  - Storage: Efficient data retention (90-day weather history max by default)
- **Scalability**: System MUST handle 10,000 concurrent schedules without degradation
- **Observability**:
  - All operations >100ms MUST be logged with duration
  - Performance metrics MUST be exposed for monitoring
  - Slow queries/operations MUST be automatically flagged

**Rationale**: Weather conditions change rapidly. Slow processing or stale data could result in incorrect scheduling decisions, such as sending workers into dangerous weather or canceling operations unnecessarily.

## Quality Gates

**Constitution Compliance Check**: Every feature MUST pass through these gates during planning:

### Gate 1: Design Phase (plan.md creation)

- [ ] **Code Quality**: Architecture review confirms single-responsibility principle, identifies reusable components
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Test plan defined with coverage targets and test types identified
- [ ] **UX Design**: User flows documented, error scenarios identified, response time budgets allocated
- [ ] **Performance Budget**: Resource constraints defined, performance targets set, monitoring strategy planned

### Gate 2: Implementation Phase (before PR merge)

- [ ] **Code Quality**: Code review confirms readability, type safety, error handling, and DRY compliance
- [ ] **Testing Verification**: All tests pass, coverage targets met, tests were written before implementation
- [ ] **UX Validation**: User feedback mechanisms tested, error messages reviewed, accessibility checked
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Benchmarks run, resource usage measured, no regressions detected

### Gate 3: Release Phase (before deployment)

- [ ] **Integration Testing**: End-to-end scenarios validated with real weather APIs
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Performance targets validated under expected load
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: Quickstart updated, API docs current, troubleshooting guide reviewed
- [ ] **Monitoring Ready**: Metrics collection verified, alerting configured

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements

- **Mandatory Review**: All code changes require approval from at least one peer
- **Constitutional Verification**: Reviewer MUST explicitly confirm compliance with all four core principles
- **Test Verification**: Reviewer MUST verify tests were written first and initially failed
- **Performance Review**: Changes affecting critical paths MUST include benchmark results

### Branch Strategy

- **Feature branches**: `###-feature-name` format aligned with spec branches
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit represents a single logical change
- **Commit messages**: Must reference task ID and user story (e.g., "T042 [US2] Implement weather alert filtering")

### Continuous Integration

- **Automated Checks** (all MUST pass before merge):
  - Linting and formatting
  - Type checking
  - Unit test suite (<5s total)
  - Integration test suite
  - Coverage validation
  - Performance regression tests
  - Accessibility compliance checks

## Governance

**Authority**: This constitution supersedes all other development practices, style guides, or conventions unless explicitly documented as exceptions below.

**Amendment Process**:
- Amendments require documented justification explaining the problem being solved
- Amendment proposals MUST include migration plan for existing code
- All templates (plan-template.md, spec-template.md, tasks-template.md) MUST be updated to reflect constitutional changes
- Version numbering follows semantic versioning:
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to core principles or removal of requirements
  - **MINOR**: New principles added or substantial guidance expansions
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic changes

**Compliance Review**:
- All pull requests MUST include constitutional compliance checklist
- Quarterly constitution review to ensure principles remain relevant
- Violations MUST be justified in Complexity Tracking section of plan.md

**Exceptions**: Complexity that violates constitutional principles MUST be justified:
- Document in plan.md Complexity Tracking table
- Explain why needed and why simpler alternatives were rejected
- Include remediation plan if technical debt
